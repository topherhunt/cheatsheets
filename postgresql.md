# PostgreSQL

## Basic navigation

- `\q` - exit
- `\?` - list all admin commands available
- `\h` - list all SQL commands available
- `\conninfo` - list info about current connection
- `\connect [database name]` - connect to a database

## Managing databases, users, roles

- `createdb $(whoami)` - create a default database for this user
- `CREATE ROLE postgres SUPERUSER CREATEDB LOGIN PASSWORD 'postgres';`

## Connecting to a remote database

- `psql -h grayowlnetwork.czo1pb6i4lc0.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U grayowlmaster -d grayowl_staging --password` (specifies host, user, database, and password (supplied in a subsequent prompt))

## Exporting & importing SQL dumps

- `pg_dump -h hostname -U username -d database_name --password > 2016-09-27-dumpfile.psql` (dump the entire database to a PSQL file that can be executed against another database to recreate the same state. Connection settings take same format as psql.)
- You can also *export a SQL dump through SSH*, which eliminates the SCP step and is handy if the server has no free disk space: `ssh grayowl "pg_dump -h hostname -U username -d database_name --password" > 2016-09-27-dumpfile.psql` (will prompt for password as normal)
- `psql -h localhost -U grayowlmaster --password grayowl_development < 2016-06-01_grayowl_staging.psql` (imports / executes a sql dump against a specified environment)

# Regex substitution

- Advanced regex replacement in Postgres:
  `regexp_replace(url, 'https?://([^\/]+\.)*([\w\d\-\_]+\.[\w]+).*', '\2')`
- You can also use `substring(url from 'expression')` but it's less powerful I think.

This query gets the top-level domain from a URL string and uses it to count how many URLs are present for each domain.

```
SELECT
	DATE(found_at),
	regexp_replace(url, 'https?://([^\/]+\.)*([\w\d\-\_]+\.[\w]+).*', '\2') AS domain,
	COUNT(id) AS num_found
FROM candidates
WHERE found_at > '2016-09-15'
GROUP BY DATE(found_at), regexp_replace(url, 'https?://([^\/]+\.)*([\w\d\-\_]+\.[\w]+).*', '\2')
LIMIT 100;
```

# Disk space usage

- `pg_size_pretty(value)` - formats a number as KB, MB, GB etc.
- The following query returns disk usage info on the current db:

```
SELECT *
FROM (
  SELECT *, total_bytes - index_bytes - COALESCE(toast_bytes,0) AS table_bytes
  FROM (
    SELECT c.oid, nspname AS table_schema, relname AS TABLE_NAME,
      c.reltuples AS row_estimate,
      pg_total_relation_size(c.oid) AS total_bytes,
      pg_indexes_size(c.oid) AS index_bytes,
      pg_total_relation_size(reltoastrelid) AS toast_bytes
    FROM pg_class c
    LEFT JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
    WHERE relkind = 'r'
  ) a
) a;
```
