## Compliance process

  * Create a document `gdpr.md` in the project, as a place to keep internal notes on GDPR compliance.

  * Complete [this GDPR checklist](https://gdprchecklist.io/). In `gdpr.md`, note any links, decisions, answers to checklist questions, etc.

  * Also review [the official GDPR checklist](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/) and ensure you don't have anything missing.

  * Prepare a spreadsheet to track GDPR requests. For each row, have the following fields:
    - Requester name
    - Requester organization (if any)
    - Requester email / contact info
    - Type (data access, data transfer, stop processing, stop profiling, forget me)
    - Due date
    - Status (new -> in progress -> completed)
    - Assignee

  * Pretend you just received [this broad GDPR request letter](https://github.com/good-lly/gdpr-documents/blob/master/data-access/en/GDPR%20data%20access.md) and practice handling it, to ensure you've got all the pieces in place.


## Handling data requests

  * Start by confirming their identity. Ask for a scan of a photo id (eg. passport or drivers license). I should refuse any requesters who don't prove who they are.
