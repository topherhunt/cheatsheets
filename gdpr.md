## Implementing

  * Complete [this GDPR checklist](https://gdprchecklist.io/).
  * Also review [the official GDPR checklist](https://gdpr.eu/checklist/) and ensure you don't have anything missing.
  * Prepare a spreadsheet to track GDPR requests. For each row, have the following fields:
    - Requester name
    - Requester organization (if any)
    - Requester email / contact info
    - Type (data access, data transfer, stop processing, stop profiling, forget me)
    - Due date
    - Status (new -> in progress -> completed)
    - Assignee
  * Pretend you just received [this broad GDPR request letter](https://github.com/good-lly/gdpr-documents/blob/master/data-access/en/GDPR%20data%20access.md) and practice handling it, to ensure you've got all the pieces in place.
