# Web development on Windows 11

## Misc notes

- Useful reference for a Win11 WSL web dev setup: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2cvWsXX1ds
- VS Code with WSL extension, so you can access WSL via the built-in terminal.
- ThunderClient for API request emulation, built into VS Code.
- You can use Homebrew for package mgmt. Brew isn't just for Mac.
- Supposedly WSL integrates nicely w Docker if need be.
- WSL port-forwards nicely, so a web app started within WSL can be accessed in your Windows browser.
