# I18n / translation of a Phoenix app using Gettext


## Setup

is pretty straightforward.

  * On each request you need to detect what locale to use. Add a plug to `router.ex`:

    ```rb
    # ADD THIS NEAR THE TOP:
    import MyAppWeb.LocalePlugs, only: [detect_locale: 2]

    # ADD THIS PLUG IN THE END OF EACH RELEVANT PIPELINE:
    plug :detect_locale
    ```

  * Write `lib/my_app_web/plugs/locale_plugs.ex`:

    ```rb
    defmodule MyAppWeb.LocalePlugs do
      import Plug.Conn, only: [get_session: 2, get_req_header: 2, put_session: 3, halt: 1]
      import Phoenix.Controller, only: [redirect: 2]

      # Decide what locale this request should use.
      # If it's given in a GET param, store it in the session and refresh to clear the param.
      # If it's set in the session, use that. Otherwise fall back to the browser setting or en.
      def detect_locale(conn, _opts) do
        if locale = conn.params["locale"] do
          conn
          |> put_session(:locale, locale)
          |> redirect(to: conn.request_path)
          |> halt()
        else
          session_locale = get_session(conn, :locale)
          browser_locale = get_req_header(conn, "Accept-Language") |> List.first()
          locale = whitelist(session_locale) || whitelist(browser_locale) || "en"

          Gettext.put_locale(MyAppWeb.Gettext, locale)
          conn
        end
      end

      defp whitelist(locale) do
        if locale in Gettext.known_locales(MyAppWeb.Gettext), do: locale
      end
    end
    ```

  * Add a locale switcher dropdown to your navbar (example uses Bootstrap):

    ```
    <!-- After the user dropdown </li> -->
    <% current_locale = Gettext.get_locale(MyAppWeb.Gettext) %>
    <% other_locales = Gettext.known_locales(MyAppWeb.Gettext) -- [current_locale] %>
    <li class="nav-item dropdown">
      <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" data-toggle="dropdown">
        <%= flag_for_locale(current_locale) %> <span class="caret"></span>
      </a>
      <div class="dropdown-menu dropdown-menu-right">
        <%= for locale <- other_locales do %>
          <%= link "#{flag_for_locale(locale)} #{String.upcase(locale)}", to: "?locale=#{locale}", class: "dropdown-item" %>
        <% end %>
      </div>
    </li>
    ```

  * In `gettext.ex`, add define the `flag_for_locale` helper used in the dropdown:

    ```rb
    def flag_for_locale(locale) do
      %{
        "en" => "ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸",
        "nl" => "ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡±",
        "es" => "ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸"
      }[locale]
    end
    ```

  * Go through your templates etc. and update all user-facing text to use `gettext` calls.
    Try to keep gettext strings compile-time static if possible (not computed).

    ```rb
    # Unless you're in a view or controller, you'll need to import the module first:
    import MyAppWeb.Gettext

    # Simple string example
    <%= gettext("My English text goes here")

    # Example with interpolated variables
    <%= gettext("How much %{object} can an %{actor} chuck", object: @object, actor: @actor)

    # Example of domain-scoped string
    <%= dgettext("countries", "Turkey")

    # Example of pluralizable string
    <%= gettext("Houston, we have a problem", "Houston, we have multiple problems", 3)
    ```

  * If your client-side JS needs to access some translation strings, define a `gettext(text)` function in the JS global namespace by including this script in your layout header:

    ```
    <%# I'm not sure what's the best-practice way to pass Gettext strings to JS code. %>
    <%# For now we'll define all JS-relevant strings in the page header. %>
    <%# Thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/a/48704265/1729692 %>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var translations = <%= raw Jason.encode!(%{
        "Please fill in your name." => gettext("Please fill in your name."),
        "Loading..." => gettext("Loading..."),
        "Error!" => gettext("Error!"),
        "Video info" => gettext("Video info"),
        "Speaker:" => gettext("Speaker:"),
        "Question:" => gettext("Question:"),
        "apply" => gettext("apply"),
        "Really delete this tag?" => gettext("Really delete this tag?"),
        "Make a selection in the timeline first." => gettext("Make a selection in the timeline first."),
        "Add a new tag" => gettext("Add a new tag"),
        "Really delete this tagging?" => gettext("Really delete this tagging?"),
        "That's all the clips we have for your search. Adjust your filters to see more." => gettext("That's all the clips we have for your search. Adjust your filters to see more."),
        "Clear all selected tags" => gettext("Clear all selected tags"),
      }) %>;

      // Now in any JS file, I can call `gettext("the string to translate")`.
      // Any missing keys will raise an error (and in prod, will be reported to Rollbar).
      gettext = function(key) {
        if (translations[key]) {
          return translations[key];
        } else {
          throw("Error: Missing gettext key \""+key+"\"");
        }
      };
    </script>
    ```


## Syncing translations

You'll repeat these steps (or a subset) whenever you change the source text.

  * Run `mix gettext.extract`. This detects all `gettext` strings in your code and adds them to a "master template" `.pot` file under `priv/gettext/`.

  * Run `mix gettext.merge priv/gettext/` to merge this `.pot` file into all defined locales' `.po` files, adding and removing entries from the .po as necessary.

  * To create a new locale, run `mix gettext.merge priv/gettext --locale nl`.
    (See `mix help gettext.extract` and `mix help gettext.merge` for more detailed usage.)

  * Now you can fill in each locale's translations. Various approaches:

    - Manually edit each `.po` file to in the empty `msgstr ""` strings. DO NOT touch the lines starting with `msgid`, this will cause your entry to not be matched! (Ignore the `en` locale; the EN strings can stay blank as they'll default to using the `msgid` value.)

    - Or you could use https://poedit.net/ to give the translator a friendly UI and some helpful syntax/sanity checks.

    - Or if you're in a rush, use my [machine translation script](https://github.com/topherhunt/topher-utilities/blob/master/machine_translate.rb) which fills in all blank strings in a pofile with Google Cloud Translate translations. (Caveat: the output needs careful manual review & cleanup.)

  * After each merge, manually review any translations marked "fuzzy". Update the wording as needed, then delete the ", fuzzy" tag.

  * Once you've filled in a page's worth of translations for each locale, start up the dev server and test it out. You should be able to use the navbar switcher to switch locales, and your locale setting should be remembered for as long as you're logged in.


## Tips

  * Don't include leading/trailing whitespace in gettext strings. Where possible, put the space outside of the string. It's easy to lose a leading space when translating.

  * Having many Gettext locales may slow down app compilation. To fix it: https://angelika.me/2020/09/02/speed-up-the-compilation-of-elixir-projects-that-use-gettext/
