# PHP

## Old versions

- Some old versions can be super hard to get online, and tricky to compile. The PHPfarm library makes it easier - a set of scripts to install each specific old version of PHP. https://github.com/cweiske/phpfarm Runs great on Ubuntu 14.04 with standard PHP & dev packages installed. Doesn't run great on Mac OSX.
